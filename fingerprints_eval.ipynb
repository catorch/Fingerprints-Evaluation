    "# Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform a comprehensive evaluation of different molecule fingerprints or characterization methods for machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, you should follow a systematic approach. Here are the key steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Research Objectives and Hypotheses**\n",
    "   - Clearly state the objectives of your study.\n",
    "   - Formulate hypotheses or research questions regarding the effectiveness of various fingerprint methods in ML/DL models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Literature Review**\n",
    "   - Conduct a thorough literature review to understand current methods and findings.\n",
    "   - Identify gaps in existing research that your study aims to fill.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dataset Acquisition**\n",
    "   - **Source Datasets**: Identify and download relevant chemical datasets. Public repositories like ChEMBL, PubChem, or ZINC can be good starting points.\n",
    "   - **Criteria for Selection**: Ensure datasets are relevant to the objectives of your study (e.g., drug-like molecules for drug discovery).\n",
    "   - https://github.com/catorch/LLaMA-Mol/blob/main/target_molecules.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "   - **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, filter out irrelevant or erroneous entries.\n",
    "   - **Standardization**: Standardize molecular representations (e.g., converting to SMILES or InChI formats).\n",
    "   - **Normalization**: If necessary, normalize properties or descriptors.\n",
    "   - https://github.com/catorch/LLaMA-Mol/blob/main/4_target_prediction_regression_model.ipynb\n",

    "   - Evalute fingerprints with dimensionality reduction to see which ones are the least affected. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Model Selection**\n",
    "   - Choose appropriate ML/DL models. Common choices include Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, etc.\n",

    "   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.\n",
    "   - Train models on the training set using different fingerprints as features.\n",
    "   - Tune hyperparameters using the validation set.\n",
    "   - https://github.com/catorch/LLaMA-Mol/blob/main/6_target_prediction_classification_model_2.ipynb\n",
    "   - https://github.com/catorch/iayaa/blob/main/MNA_IAyAA_semana_5_Actividad.ipynb\n",

    "   - Compare the performance of models using different fingerprints.\n",
    "   - https://github.com/catorch/iayaa/blob/main/MNA_IAyAA_semana_2_Actividad_(1).ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Statistical Analysis**\n",

    "\n",
    "11. **Interpretation and Discussion**\n",
    "    - Interpret the results in the context of your research objectives.\n",
    "    - Discuss why certain fingerprints perform better or worse with different models.\n",

    "tldr; There is not necessarily a \"best\" fingerprint method because there are many, many ways to generate fingerprints. ECFP4 or ECFP6 with >2048 bits is usually decent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, a fingerprint is some large vector, typically binary, used for similarity-based screening and more recently machine learning. The elements of the fingerprint are some type of chemical descriptor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some recent reviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Machine learning in chemoinformatics and drug discovery\" Drug Discovery Today 2018, v. 23, August pp. 1538-1546\n",
    "\"Similarity Searching Using 2D Structural Fingerprints\" Methods Mol Biol. 2011 v. 672 pp. 133-58.\n",
    "IMHO, there are a few general categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural pattern fingerprints (e.g. MACCS) - sets of functional group patterns (e.g. alkyl chains, aromatic rings, ketones, ..) one bit or count per functional group in the fingerprint.\n",
    "Daylight-style linear fingerprints - take the atom, and it's linear neighbors\n",
    "Circular-style fingerprints (e.g. ECFP) - generating a radius or diameter around the neighbors of an atom. Like the linear fingerprints, these can essentially generate an infinite number of patterns, so it's hashed to a fixed bit vector\n",
    "3D property fingerprints - interatomic distances, surfaces, electrostatic fields, etc.\n",
    "There are countless new fingerprint schemes produced each year, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Neural Fingerprints\" https://github.com/HIPS/neural-fingerprint - convolutional neural networks to design the best fingerprints for a particular property set\n",
    "MinHash fingerprints https://github.com/reymond-group/mhfp - a better hashing scheme for the high-dimensional ECFP-style circular fingerprint\n",
    "Open Babel can compute a few pattern-style fingerprints (FP3, FP4, and MACCS), the Daylight-style linear FP2 fingerprint, and a variety of ECFP circular fingerprint styles, e.g. ECFP4.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDKit can generate a whole pile of fingerprints too: http://rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html#fingerprinting-and-molecular-similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "You might say, but is there a good place to start? The Morgan circular / ECFP fingerprints are really good, especially with a fairly large bit vector (e.g. 2048 bits per molecule) to hash."
